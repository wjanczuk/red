# Stackathon | Red

**Red** is a women's health/fertility iOS/Android app developed using React Native. 

It was begun during a 4-day "Stackathon" (Hackathon), for the [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/) at Fullstack Academy, and remains in progress. 

I spent 5.5 years with a non-profit called [FEMM](https://www.femmhealth.org), which is revolutionizing the way in which women and medical providers think about endocrinology. FEMM offers an entirely science-backed eponymous [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/femm-period-ovulation-tracker/id944880989)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.femmhealth.femm&hl=en_US&gl=US) app for women. As a former staff member, who worked on manual app testing as well as database seeding with no experience coding a backend or data-driven front-end, as well as a certified FEMM Teacher, certified to teach FEMM's research-based education modules, I took the opportunity to apply pre-existing knowledge to the process of learning React Native from scratch as an exercise in mock app development.

The fully completed app "Red" is intended to include a complex, responsive, research-based algorithm that personalizes feedback for women regarding their health and fertility based on their individual, daily symptom-based inputs, such as cervical mucus, body temperature, and more. The pattern of these inputs reflects the degree to which a woman is or is not fully healthy, and the production of certain biomarkers reflects the given status of her fertility. The specific algorithm is a form of IP (so I won't push any algorithmic content here), but the contexual [science](https://femmhealth.org/the-science/) and [research](https://femmhealth.org/professional-education/research/) can be found online.

FEMM's integration between research and persons stands as one example of (health)tech with immense repercussions on the future we're building. Think [Elon Musk's cleverness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwLWfaAg-8&ab_channel=TED) with regards to environmental and planeterary infrastructure, take a few (theoretical) steps to the left, and apply it toward the development of infrastructure that brings about the highest form of health integrity in persons *qua* persons.

(As a result of the app's production status, it was never formally deployed.)
