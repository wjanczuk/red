# Stackathon | Red

**Red** is a women's health/fertility iOS/Android app developed using React Native. It was created during a four-day "Stackathon" (Hackathon), for the [Grace Hopper Program](https://www.gracehopper.com/) at Fullstack Academy.

**Background:** I spent 5.5 years with a non-profit called [FEMM](https://www.femmhealth.org), which is revolutionizing the way in which women and medical providers think about endocrinology. FEMM offers an entirely science-backed eponymous iOS/Android app for women, and as a certified FEMM Teacher, I took the opportunity to apply pre-existing knowledge to the process of learning a new technology.
